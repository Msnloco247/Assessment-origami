✨ Key Features
Page Object Model (POM): Decouples test logic from UI locators, ensuring that changes in the UI only require updates in a single place.

Advanced Logging: Integrated Winston to provide a professional logging system. It tracks the execution flow and captures detailed error messages in both the console and a persistent log file.

DRY Principle: Validation logic is centralized in reusable functions to avoid code duplication and improve readability.

Robust Error Handling: Custom try-catch blocks within Page Objects to ensure failures are logged with context before being reported.

📝 Test Scenarios
Positive Login: Validates that a user can log in with correct credentials and is redirected to the secure area.

Invalid Username: Verifies that an appropriate error message is displayed and the user remains on the login page.
